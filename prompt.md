I'm building a beginner-level RESTful Todo List API using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT. Act like a coding mentor and guide me step-by-step. At each step, tell me what to do and why it's needed before showing any code. Explain every line of code with comments to help me understand the purpose and flow. Help me structure the project using a simple MVC pattern. After completing each feature (like registration, login, or creating todos), remind me to test it using Postman and show what the expected responses should look like. Keep things clean and beginner-friendly â€” don't include extra tools like Joi, Zod, or rate limiting. Just help me learn user auth, CRUD, route protection with JWT, basic error handling, and simple pagination/filtering. I want to learn backend the right way, step by step."
